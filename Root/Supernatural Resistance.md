**Type:** Passive — Defensive Adaptation / Warrior

**Description:**  
Through intense physical conditioning and battlefield experience, the Warrior’s body has adapted to endure and mitigate certain supernatural forces. Rather than resisting through magic, they rely on sheer resilience, instinct, and physical mastery to withstand spiritual pressure, unnatural energies, and abnormal environmental effects.

**Effects:**

- Reduced impact from supernatural forces that directly affect the body (shockwaves, pressure, elemental bursts, fear auras affecting movement, etc.)
    
- Advantage on physical resistance checks against supernatural knockback, forced movement, or destabilizing effects
    
- Partial resistance against environmental supernatural hazards (unnatural cold, heat, pressure, corrupted terrain — GM discretion)
    
- Can continue fighting effectively even while under mild supernatural interference
    

**Limitations:**

- Does **not** provide immunity to high-tier spiritual, mental, or conceptual attacks
    
- Does not negate direct spell damage; only reduces secondary physical effects
    
- Strong Beyonder abilities may still overwhelm resistance
