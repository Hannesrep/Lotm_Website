**Description:**  
The user can communicate with nearby spirits, either for reconnaissance or to command them to perform simple tasks. Spirits can act as eyes, ears, or minor manipulators in the environment, helping the user gain tactical advantages.

### **Mechanics**

#### **1. Spirit Recon**

- Communicate with 1 nearby spirit
    
- Allows the user to **scout areas**, detect enemies, or gather information
    
- Spirits relay sensory information (sight, sound, location) back to the user

#### **2. Spirit Command**

- Direct spirits to perform **simple actions**:
    
    - Grasp or immobilize a target (restraining for 1 round)
        
    - Fetch small objects
        
    - Minor environmental interaction
        
- Spirits cannot attack physically or cause direct damage

### **Limitations**


- Only nearby spirits can be contacted
    
- Spirits act according to their own abilities and willingness; extremely powerful or hostile spirits may resist commands
    

⚠ **Warning:** Spirits are semi-autonomous — miscommunication or defiance can create danger for the user or allies.
