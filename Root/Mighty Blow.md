**Type:** Active — Burst Strike / Assassin  
**Cost:** Level 1 Spell Slot
**Range:** Melee  
**Action:** Action

**Description:**  
The Assassin releases all accumulated physical force into a single devastating attack. When delivered from stealth or superior positioning, the strike becomes extremely difficult to avoid and can critically injure targets instantly.

### **Base Mechanics**

- Make one melee attack roll
    
- If attacking from stealth or surprise → target has disadvantage on defense/reaction
    
- Counts as **Burst Damage** (not multi-hit)
    
- Cannot be combined with multi-attack abilities unless GM allows
