**Type:** Active — Aura / Support & Protection

**Description:**  
The user manifests a radiant solar halo that strengthens allies and weakens darkness. The aura reinforces morale, improves resistance to corruption, and causes discomfort to shadow-aligned enemies.

**Core Mechanics:**

- Allies inside aura gain bonus to mental saves and fear resistance
    
- Minor regeneration or stamina recovery for all in range (+5 health?, maybe get on lvl 1 spell slot back? GM desides :) )
    
- Enemies aligned with darkness suffer disadvantage on stealth or intimidation
