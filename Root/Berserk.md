### **Description**

A Lunatic’s defining trait is the ability to **voluntarily sacrifice rationality**, allowing suppressed desires and primal impulses to erupt. In exchange, they gain overwhelming enhancements across all physical parameters.

Unlike unstable frenzy states, this transformation is **self-initiated and controlled at the threshold of madness** — the user chooses to let go.

- Aggression and combat instinct sharpened.

### **Mental State**

- Logical reasoning becomes blurred.
    
- Strategic thinking is reduced to instinct-driven decision-making.
    
- Desires and impulses strongly influence actions.
    

Despite the mental haze, the Lunatic does not completely lose awareness and can still distinguish allies from enemies.

### **Limitations**

- Poor fine control and tactical precision while active.
    
- After the state ends, temporary fatigue or emotional backlash may occur.
    
- Extended or repeated activation risks gradual psychological instability.
