**Description:**  
Divination allows the user to obtain guidance and hidden information by communicating indirectly with the spirit world through symbolic interpretation. The user asks focused questions and receives answers in the form of intuition, symbolic visions, emotional impressions, or ritual outcomes. Divination does not provide absolute truth but rather probabilistic insight shaped by spirituality, fate, and interference.

The accuracy, depth, and clarity of answers depend on the user’s Sequence level, preparation, and the complexity of the question.

Divination works best for:

- predicting short-term outcomes
    
- locating objects or people
    
- evaluating danger levels
    
- verifying truths or lies
    
- gaining directional guidance rather than exact facts

- Long-term future predictions are unreliable
    
- High-level entities or artifacts may block or distort results

### **Drawbacks & Risks**
