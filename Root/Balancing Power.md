**Type:** Passive — Stability / Kinetic Control

**Description:**  
The user possesses exceptional equilibrium and kinetic awareness. Sudden movement, unstable terrain, violent waves, or powerful recoil no longer easily disrupt posture. This passive stability reflects the Sailor’s ability to remain upright and combat-ready even during chaos.

**Effects:**

- Cannot be knocked prone or forced into disadvantage due to unstable terrain (GM discretion for extreme effects)
    
- Advantage on balance, stance, and movement-based checks
