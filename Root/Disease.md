**Type:** Active — Biological Affliction / Demoness of Affliction  
**Cost:** Level 2 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 30–50 meters  
**Duration:** 2–3 minutes (disease progression)

**Description:**  
The Demoness of Affliction can generate multiple airborne pathogens, accelerating infection and the onset of diseases far beyond natural speed. By controlling the wind, she can spread these pathogens over a wide area, affecting multiple targets.

### **Effects**

- Infect targets within 30 m 
    
- Initial 10 seconds: incubation — mild symptoms (allergies, fever, cough, sneezing)
    
- 20–30 seconds: moderate illness (pneumonia, bronchitis, systemic weakness)
    
- 2–3 minutes: critical illness (cardiac arrest, brain aneurysm, organ failure)
    
- Infection speed and severity scale with target’s constitution
    

**Environmental Interaction:**

- Fire and extreme heat (e.g., Pyromaniac flames) can destroy pathogens and reduce infection effectiveness
    
- Wind manipulation can increase effective range and infection coverage
    

### **Scaling (Seq 7–5)**

**Seq 5 — Full Affliction:** Large area infection; rapid progression to critical illness; can overwhelm even physically robust targets

### **Limitations**

- Pathogens can be mitigated or destroyed by fire, extreme heat, or purification spells
    
- Strong immune constitution may delay or resist full effects
    
⚠ Targets can resist partially via magical protection, physical shielding, or environmental barriers.
