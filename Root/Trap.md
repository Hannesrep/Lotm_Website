**Type:** Active — Tactical Preparation / Hunter Pathway  
**Cost:** Preparation + Materials  
**Range:** Environment-Based  
**Duration:** Until Triggered or Disarmed

**Description:**  
Hunters can prepare mechanical, environmental, and explosive traps within their surroundings. Traps activate when specific trigger conditions are met.

## **Effects**

- Place mechanical traps (snare, tripwire, pitfall)
    
- Rig explosive traps
    
- Apply poison-trigger mechanisms
    
- Exploit natural hazards (unstable cliffs, weak terrain, choke points)
    
- Memorise environmental alterations perfectly
    

## **Scaling

### **Seq 9 — Basic Trapper**

- Simple mechanical traps
    
- Single-target restraint or minor damage
    
- Natural hazard recognition
    
- Limited number of active traps
    

### **Seq 8 — Tactical Hunter**

- Improved trap placement efficiency
    
- Can combine trap effects (snare + poison)
    
- Basic explosive traps
    
- Enhanced spatial memory
    

### **Seq 7 — Combat Trapper**

- Can deploy simple traps during combat
    
- Multiple traps active simultaneously
    
- Moderate explosive payloads
    
- Trigger customization (proximity, weight, delay)
    

### **Seq 6 — Demolition Specialist**

- Advanced explosive traps
    
- Multi-stage traps
    
- Can alter battlefield terrain
    
- Strong area-denial capability
    

### **Seq 5 — Master of the Hunt**

- Highly concealed traps
    
- Large-area control
    
- Chain-reaction trap systems
    
- Environmental manipulation at high efficiency
    

## **Limitations**

- Requires preparation time or materials
    
- Traps can be detected and disarmed
    
- Effectiveness depends on terrain
