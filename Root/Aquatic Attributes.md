The user’s body adapts to maritime environments. Movement in water becomes natural, breathing control improves, and balance against waves or unstable footing increases dramatically. The user operates effectively during storms, ship combat, and aquatic traversal.

**Effects:**

- Increased swim speed and underwater maneuverability
    
- Extended breath-holding capacity
    
- No disadvantage from fighting or moving in water
    
- Advantage on checks related to sailing, swimming, or storm survival
