**Type:** Active — Conceptual Law Imposition  
**Cost:** Level 4 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 30 meters (unless stated otherwise)  
**Action:** Action (spoken in Mystical Language)  
**Duration:** Varies (1 round – concentration-based – situational)

## **Description**

A Sequence 6 Judge can temporarily impose semantic authority over reality itself.

By speaking a word or structured sentence in Mystical Language (e.g., Ancient Hermes), the Judge forces the world to interpret the declared meaning and convert it into a limited physical, spiritual, or conceptual result.

Power depends on:

- Clarity of declaration
    
- Authority differential
    
- Target Sequence level
    

Higher-level entities resist more effectively.

## **Death**

**Range:** Melee (dash toward target)

The Judge declares **“Death.”**  
An invisible force accelerates them forward in a near-instant strike.

### Mechanics

- Immediate high-speed dash
    
- Melee spell attack
    
- Generates afterimages
    
- Counts as Burst Damage
    

### Damage (Seq 6 Base)

- **5d10** bonus damage (add weapon damage normally)
    
- Partial physical resistance bypass
    
- On hit → target makes CON save or suffers severe wound (−2 to physical rolls for 1 round)

## **Flog**

**Range:** 20 meters

A spectral spiked whip manifests above the target.

### Mechanics

- Spell attack roll
    
- Ignores cover from above
    
- Causes tearing physical + spirit damage
    

### Damage

- **4d10** hybrid damage
    
- On hit → armor shredded (−1 AC equivalent for 1 round)
    
- On failed CON save → bleeding condition
    

---

## **Imprison**

**Range:** 20 meters  
**Duration:** Concentration (up to 2 rounds)

The air around the target solidifies into viscous transparent confinement.

### Mechanics

- Target makes STR or Spirit save
    
- On failure → restrained
    
- Works on Spirit Bodies
    

---

## **Release**

Ends one active Verdict effect immediately.

- No roll required
    
- Bonus Action
    

---

## **Confinement**

**Range:** Room-sized area (~10–15m radius)  
**Duration:** Concentration

Seals an area completely.

### Effects

- Prevents entry and exit
    
- Blocks Spirit Bodies
    
- Functions as layered invisible barrier
    

Entities 1+ Sequence higher can strain against it (contested check).

---

## **Exile**

**Range:** 30 meters

An overwhelming invisible force blasts targets away.

### Mechanics

- STR or Spirit save
    
- On failure → violently expelled 20–40 meters
    
- Affects Spirit Bodies
    
- Can bypass Confinement barriers
    

Damage:

- **3d10** force damage + prone

# **Prohibition**

**Type:** Full Sentence Verdict  
**Range:** 20m radius area  
**Duration:** Concentration (up to 2 rounds)

The Judge declares:

> “This place Prohibits the use of ___.”

### Mechanics

- Defines one restricted action, state, or entity
    
- Examples:
    
    - Flight
        
    - Teleportation
        
    - Beyonder powers
        
    - Spirit manifestation
        
    - Specific entity types (e.g., Wraiths)
        

### Effect

- Targets must pass Spirit save to act against rule
    
- On failure → action automatically negated
    

---

### Scaling Rule (Critical Balance)

If target is:

- Same Sequence → normal resistance
    
- 1 Sequence higher → advantage on saves
    
- 2+ higher → Prohibition heavily suppressed
    
- 1+ lower → significantly harder to resist
    

Prohibition does not overwrite fundamental laws permanently — it imposes temporary semantic dominance.

# ⚖ **Limitations**

- Requires clear speech in Mystical Language
    
- Silence effects disable usage
    
- High Spiritual cost
    
- Cannot stack multiple Prohibitions simultaneously
    
- Strong conceptual entities resist more easily
