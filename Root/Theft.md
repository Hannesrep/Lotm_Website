**Type:** Active — Stealth / Conceptual Stealing  
**Pathway:** Marauder  
**Cost:** 1 Level 1 Spell Slot _(Seq 9–6)_ / 1 Level 2 Spell Slot _(Seq 5 upgrade)_  
**Activation:** Action

**Description:**  
The user attempts to steal from a target through speed, deception, and subtle spiritual interference. At lower Sequences, Theft focuses on physical items and carried objects. As the Marauder advances, the ability evolves into conceptual stealing — allowing the user to take abilities, energy, or supernatural resources directly from a target.

The outcome is always partially unpredictable, reflecting the chaotic nature of the Marauder pathway.

### **Effect by Sequence**

**Sequence 9–6 — Physical Theft**

- Make a Dexterity-based check against the target
    
- On success: steal **one random carried item** or small object
    
- Target may remain unaware if check greatly exceeds defense
    
- Cannot steal equipped heavy armor or bound artifacts (GM discretion)
    

**Sequence 5 — Conceptual Theft (Upgrade)**  
On successful activation, steal **one random resource** from the target:

- Random skill, ability or thoughts (target wont know what to do anymore)
    
- One spell slot or equivalent energy resource
    
- Active buff or enhancement effect
    

_(Result determined randomly or by GM roll)_

### **Limitations**

- Requires proximity (melee or short range unless otherwise allowed)
    
- Unique high-sequence abilities may be partially degraded when stolen
    
- Theft results are **never fully controlled** by the user 
    

### **Drawbacks & Risks**

- Failed attempts may alert the target immediately
    
- Conceptual theft may cause spiritual backlash or instability
    
- Stolen skills are instantly used without consuming a spell slot
