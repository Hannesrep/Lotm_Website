The Demoness of Pleasure can generate nearly invisible, spider silk-like Threads from her hair to manipulate, restrain, and observe enemies. These Threads are versatile tools for offense, defense, and information gathering.

- **Environmental Usage:** Threads can be attached to walls, ceilings, or floors to trip, tangle, or track enemies.

**Seq 5:** Master Threads — full-body control on contact, multiple entanglements, precise feedback on enemy movements, highly resistant cocoon

### **Limitations**
