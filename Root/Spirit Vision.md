**Type:** Active — Spiritual Perception  
**Cost:** 1 Level 1 Spell Slot  
**Activation:** Instant (can be ended at any time without additional time cost)

**Description:**  
Spirit Vision allows the user to perceive the spiritual layer underlying reality. When activated, the user’s sight shifts beyond the physical world, revealing auras, emotional imprints, invisible entities, Beyonder influences, and traces left behind by supernatural activities. The clarity and depth of analysis depend on the user’s Sequence level.

While active, the user interprets spiritual information through symbolic colors, distortions, and intuitive impressions rather than literal visual data.
