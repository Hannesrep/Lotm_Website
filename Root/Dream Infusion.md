**Type:** Active — Mental Infiltration / Dream Manipulation  
**Requirement:** **Sequence 5**  
**Spell Cost:** Level 2 Spell Slot  
**Activation:** Action (Target must be asleep, unconscious, or in a weakened mental state)  
**Range:** 30 feet or existing spiritual connection (GM discretion)

**Description:**  
Dream Infusion allows the user to enter and subtly manipulate the dreams of a target, planting ideas, extracting information, or influencing emotional states. Rather than full mind control, the ability works through suggestion, symbolic imagery, and subconscious influence — making victims believe thoughts originated from themselves.

This ability is commonly used for interrogation, long-term manipulation, memory distortion, or preparing targets for later deception.

### **Effects 

- Enter a target’s dreamscape and observe symbolic mental imagery
    
- Plant **one suggestion, fear, or emotional trigger**
    
- Extract vague memories or hidden desires (GM interpretation)
    
- Influence next-day behavior
    
- Detect hidden trauma, fears, or subconscious motivations
    

**Advanced Use (High Success Roll):**

- Implant false memory fragments
    
- Cause temporary confusion upon waking
    
- Establish emotional trust or paranoia toward chosen person
    

### **Limitations**

- Target must be asleep or mentally vulnerable
    
- Strong-willed targets may partially resist or distort dreams
    
- Cannot directly control physical actions
    

### **Drawbacks & Risks**

- Mental backlash from unstable dreamscapes
    
- Exposure to traumatic memories may cause user stress effects
    
- Failed infiltration may alert target subconsciously
