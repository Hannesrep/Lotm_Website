**Description:**  
Apothecaries specialize in the **creation of medicinal brews, herbal mixtures, and alchemical concoctions**, using refined herbs, minerals, and animal remains. These preparations allow them to **treat most common illnesses, stabilize injuries, enhance physical capabilities, or induce specific physiological effects**.

Their expertise lies in diagnosis, extraction, refinement, and controlled blending of natural essences.

However, Apothecaries **cannot cure terminal illnesses**. In advanced, late-stage conditions, they can only **alleviate symptoms, reduce pain, or slow disease progression**, but not eliminate the root cause.
