**Description:**  
The Provoker identifies emotional weaknesses and exploits them through targeted insults, humiliation, and psychological pressure, destabilizing the target’s composure.


## **Effects**

- Forces target to make a Will / Composure save
    
- On failure:
    
    - Target prioritizes the Provoker as primary threat
        
    - Suffers reduced tactical judgment
        
    - More likely to act aggressively rather than strategically
        
- Effect strength increases if insults are tailored to the target

    - Emits a repugnant aura that incites hostility
        

## **Scaling**
