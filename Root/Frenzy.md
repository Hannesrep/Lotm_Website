**Description:**  
Frenzy is a psychological overload triggered by exploiting emotional weaknesses and behavioral patterns observed through **Body Language Analysis (BLA)**. Instead of a physical attack, the user induces a sudden surge of instability within the target’s mind, forcing them into a reckless, uncontrolled mental state.

### **Core Mechanics**

- **Normal Use:**
    
    - Frenzy is a standard enhanced attack (roll to hit normally).
        
- **After Successful BLA:**
    
    - Can be activated as a **Bonus Action**
        
    - The attack **automatically counts as a Critical Hit**
        
    - Must target the same creature analyzed with BLA
        
    - Must be used within the same turn or next turn (GM choice)
        

### **Damage Scaling by Sequence**

- **Seq 7:** Base damage +1d6
    
- **Seq 6:** Base damage +1d8
    
- **Seq 5:** Base weapon damage +1d10
    

(Critical Hit doubles dice as per your system rules.)

### **Additional Effects**

- Target suffers disadvantage on concentration / mental checks while affected

### **Limitations**

- Requires successful **Body Language Analysis** to trigger crit mechanic
    
- Only one **Auto-Crit Frenzy** per target per encounter 
    
- Requires clear observation of target movement/body behavior
