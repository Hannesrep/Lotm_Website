**Description:**  
Power Siphoning allows the user to drain supernatural strength, buffs, or active enhancements from a target — but only if the user understands the nature of the ability being siphoned. The deeper the user’s knowledge, the more efficiently the power can be extracted and reused.


**Sequence 7 — Surface Drain**

- Drain **active buffs** or temporary enhancements
    
- Remove minor magical effects from target
    
- Gain small temporary bonus (+1 to relevant stat or next roll — GM discretion)
    
- Requires basic knowledge of the ability
    

**Sequence 6 — Functional Siphon**

- Drain partial supernatural energy or spell power
    
- Target loses one active enhancement or minor resource
    
- User gains temporary buff or minor energy reserve
    
- May weaken summoned constructs or ongoing effects
    

**Sequence 5 — Deep Power Extraction**

- Drain **spell slot / supernatural resource** (GM equivalent)
    
- Temporarily copy a weakened version of an active ability
    
- Suppress a target’s enhancement for several turns
    
- High success may convert siphoned power into temporary spiritual shield
    

### **Limitations**

- Requires prior knowledge or successful analysis (e.g., Decrypt / Observation)
    
- Cannot siphon abilities vastly above user’s Sequence
