**Type:** Passive — Combat Proficiency / Warrior

**Description:**  
Warriors possess absolute mastery over all forms of weapons and armor. No weapon is unfamiliar to them, and no armor restricts their combat effectiveness. They instinctively understand balance, weight, handling, and battlefield application.

**Effects:**

- Can use any weapon without mastery penalties. Seq 7 and higher, automatically counts as **highest Weapon Mastery Tier** for every weapon type 
    
- No proficiency penalties with any weapon category (melee, ranged, exotic, improvised — GM discretion)
    
- Can equip and use any armor without movement or combat penalties caused by lack of training
    
- Advantage on checks related to weapon handling, maintenance, or tactical usage
    

**System Integration:**

- Always treated as **maximum mastery level** regardless of weapon rarity or complexity
    
- Can immediately use newly acquired weapons at peak efficiency
    

⚠ **Note:** Mastery does not negate magical corruption, cursed equipment effects, or incompatible supernatural requirements.
