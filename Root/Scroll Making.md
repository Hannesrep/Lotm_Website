**Type:** Active — Preparation / Delayed Spellcasting  
**Pathway:** Warlock  
**Sequence:** 6  
**Preparation Time:** 10–30 minutes per scroll  
**Activation:** Action (Scroll burns upon activation)  
**Range:** Varies by Scroll  
**Duration:** Varies

**Description:**  
At Seq 6, the Warlock can inscribe spells into specially prepared scrolls using appropriate materials and incantations.  
When activated, the scroll burns instantly and releases the stored spell without requiring further components.

Scrolls significantly reduce casting time in combat and allow pre-loaded spell access.

A Warlock may maintain a limited number of prepared scrolls (GM discretion, typically 3–6).
