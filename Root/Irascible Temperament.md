**Type:** Passive — Emotional Instability / Sailor Pathway

**Description:**  
The user has a highly reactive and volatile disposition. Certain stimuli—provocation, insults, or aggressive maneuvers—can trigger a **rage state**, causing the Sailor to focus all attention and attacks on the source of the provocation. This reflects their impulsive, storm-like nature.

**Effects:**

- When provoked by an enemy or through repeated Social/Intimidation checks, the user becomes **obsessed with the target**
    
- Gains bonus to attacks against the provoker (+1)
    
- Cannot easily switch targets while in rage state
    
- Rage may override strategic decision-making or other tactical priorities
    

**Limitations / Drawbacks:**

- Easily baited; manipulation can force the Sailor to isolate themselves or neglect other enemies/allies
    
- Rage does **not increase defense**; the user becomes more predictable and potentially vulnerable
    
- Cannot be voluntarily ended until provocation is removed or target defeated
    

⚠ **Warning:** The storm within cannot be tamed easily — enemies can exploit this weakness to manipulate or trap the Sailor.
