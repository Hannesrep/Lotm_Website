**Type:** Active — Conceptual Skill Theft  
**Spell Cost:** Level 1 Spell Slot  
**Activation:** Action  
**Range:** Touch or Short Range

**Description:**  
Steal allows the user to temporarily take non-supernatural abilities from a target — physical skills, learned techniques, or trained behaviors. The target becomes less proficient while the user gains temporary access to the stolen competence.

Unlike **Theft**, this ability targets physical skills, not items or powers.
