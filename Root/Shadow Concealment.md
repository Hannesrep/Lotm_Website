**Type:** Passive — Stealth Adaptation / Assassin

**Description:**  
The Assassin’s body subtly adapts to the art of killing — movements become silent, posture becomes predatory, and physical traits shift slightly to better suit stealth and infiltration. Their presence blends naturally into shadows and crowded environments.

**Effects:**

- Natural advantage on stealth, silent movement, and concealment checks
    
- Reduced sound from footsteps, gear, and body movement
    
- Minor control over bodily functions for short-term stealth (breathing control, slowed heartbeat — GM discretion)
