**Type:** Active — Authority / Conceptual Law  
**Pathway:** Bard → Notary (Sun Pathway)

**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 20 meters (line of sight or declared target)  
**Duration:** Instant or scene-based (effect dependent)

**Description:**  
Notarization allows the user to invoke the authority of the Sun and impose **conceptual validity** onto actions, objects, abilities, or phenomena. By “notarizing” reality, the user can confirm, strengthen, or deny effects according to divine authority rather than raw power.

Notarization does not overpower reality — it **judges** it.
