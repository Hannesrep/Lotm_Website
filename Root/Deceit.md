Deceit allows the user to subtly manipulate perception, judgment, and interpretation. Instead of directly creating illusions, the ability causes targets to misunderstand reality, draw incorrect conclusions, or overlook obvious dangers.

Victims believe their own flawed reasoning rather than realizing they are being manipulated.
