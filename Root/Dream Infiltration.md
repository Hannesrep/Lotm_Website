**Description:**  
Dream Infiltration allows the user to consciously enter and interact with a target’s dream. Within the dreamscape, the user can observe memories, influence emotions, implant symbolic suggestions, or subtly reshape perceptions. The dreamer often believes events are natural unless the manipulation is too aggressive.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Target must be asleep or unconscious
    
- User enters target’s personal dream environment
    
- Can gather information, alter emotional responses, or plant mental triggers
    
- Severe manipulation risks awakening the target or triggering mental defense
    

### **Limitations**

- Strong-willed or trained individuals may detect intrusions
    
- Directly harmful or traumatic manipulation may eject the user
    
- Psychic backlash possible if dream collapses
