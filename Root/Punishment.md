# ⚖ **Punishment**

**Type:** Active — Law Enforcement Manifestation  
**Cost:** Level 5 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 30 meters (unless otherwise specified)  
**Action:** Reaction or Action (triggered by rule violation)  
**Requirement:** Target must have violated an active **Prohibition**

---

## **Description**

At Sequence 5, a Disciplinary Paladin gains the authority to enforce consequences upon those who violate their declared laws.

Punishment is not merely an attack — it is the metaphysical execution of judgment.

Once a Prohibition is broken, the Paladin may immediately invoke a tailored retributive effect.


# ⚖ **Core Mechanics**

- Must have an active Prohibition in effect
    
- Target must violate declared rule
    
- Punishment may be triggered as a Reaction
    
- Target makes STR / CON / Spirit save (depending on punishment type)
    

If the offender is lower Sequence → disadvantage on save  
If higher Sequence → advantage on save


# ⚖ **Forms of Punishment**

## 🔥 **Burning Sentence**

> “Offenders shall be burnt at the stake.”

Golden-orange semi-transparent flames erupt around the offender.

### Effect

- **6d10** radiant/fire hybrid damage
    
- Ignores normal fire resistance
    
- Spirit-form entities take full damage
    
- On failed CON save → ongoing burn (2d10 per round for 2 rounds)
    

Particularly lethal to Specters and Wraiths.

## ⛓ **Restrictive Judgment**

> “The guilty should be restricted.”

Invisible shackles bind the target’s legs or body.

### Effect

- Target restrained for up to 2 rounds
    
- Spirit Bodies affected
    
- On failed STR save → immobilized completely
    
- On success → movement reduced by half

## ⚡ **Retributive Strike**

> “Violators will be punished.”

The Paladin surges forward with augmented speed.

### Effect

- Immediate high-speed movement (up to 30m)
    
- Melee spell attack
    
- **6d10** bonus damage
    
- Partial resistance bypass
    
- Knockdown check on failed STR save

## ☀ **Categorical Punishment**

> “Disciplinary target: Specters and Wraiths.”

The Paladin designates a creature category.

### Effect

- Body radiates sunlight-like aura
    
- Designated type takes **disadvantage** against all Punishments
    
- Passive radiant aura deals **3d10 per round** to affected category
    
- Duration: 2 rounds (concentration)

## ⚔ **Object Punishment**

The Paladin may designate a non-living object as the offender.

Example: chains binding them.

### Effect

- Designated object suffers structural rupture
    
- Automatic critical damage vs bindings or restraints
    
- Can destroy mid-tier mystical restraints (Sequence ≤6)

# ⚖ **Crime-Linked Punishment**

The Paladin may tailor punishment according to crime severity.

Minor violation → Restriction  
Severe violation → Burning Sentence  
Capital violation → Retributive Strike + Burning overlay

GM discretion recommended for narrative crimes.

# ⚖ **Scaling Impact (Sequence 5 Tier)**

- Punishment damage exceeds Verdict offensive words

# ⚖ **Limitations**

- Requires prior Prohibition
    
- Cannot stack multiple major punishments simultaneously
    
- High spiritual cost
    
- Strong conceptual or higher-Sequence entities resist partially
    
- Silence effects prevent activation
