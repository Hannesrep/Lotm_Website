### **Effects**

- Enhanced effectiveness of all Sheriff abilities within their Territory.
    
- Improved perceptive clarity and environmental awareness.
    
- Faster reaction to disturbances or abnormalities.
    
- Stronger psychological presence when exercising authority.
    

The level of amplification scales with:

Outside their Territory, they retain their Beyonder abilities but lose territorial amplification.
