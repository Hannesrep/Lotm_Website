**Type:** Active — Lethal Strike / Supernatural Infusion  
**Pathway:** Reaper  
**Spell Cost:** Bonus Action (after Weakness Investigation)  
**Range:** Melee / Ranged Attack (depends on weapon/attack)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Description:**  
Cull allows a Reaper to infuse an attack with supernatural precision to **strike vital points**, causing devastating damage. It works only after **Weakness Investigation** has been successfully used on the target.

**Effect:**

- Exploits previously identified weak points or vulnerabilities
    
- Can deal fatal damage to high-defense targets, including physical and non-physical entities
    
- Attacks can bypass normal defenses and mystical protection if roll succeeds
    

**Mechanics:**

- Requires a successful attack roll after Weakness Investigation
    
- Damage (Seq 5): 12d12 + Supernatural Modifier (very high)
    
- Critical hits automatically exploit the target’s weakest point, potentially dealing **double damage or instant incapacitation**
    
- Must hit **both rolls**: first for Weakness Investigation perception, then for Cull attack
    

**Limitations:**

- Only usable immediately following Weakness Investigation
    
- Extremely high damage; GM discretion recommended for balance
    
- Cannot be used without first identifying weaknesses
