**Type:** Active — Momentum Assault / Kinetic Enhancement  
**Pathway:** Sailor  
**Availability:** Seq 8–5  
**Spell Cost:** Level 1 Spell Slot  
**Range:** Self (enhanced attacks)  
**Duration:** Instant, each hit has to be rolled

**Description:**  
Raging Blows channels the Sailor’s storm-like aggression into overwhelming combat momentum. Instead of a single strike, the user enters a state of relentless offensive flow where each attack carries increasing force, pressure, and destabilizing power. The ability reflects the chaotic, crashing rhythm of ocean waves — each blow building upon the last.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Gain enhanced melee or physical attacks for the duration
    
- Each successful hit increases momentum stacks (max determined by GM)
    
- Momentum grants increasing damage (Dmg: 1d4, for each succesfull hit +1 dmg(momentum counter))
    
- Targets may be pushed, destabilized, or forced into disadvantage after repeated hits
    

### **Scaling by Sequence**

- **Seq 8:**
    - Minor stagger (Initative = last for this round) after 2 successful attacks
        
- **Seq 7:**
    - Increased momentum scaling (+1)
        
- **Seq 6:**
    - Hits may push or knock enemies off stance = disadvantage on next save if still of stance
        
- **Seq 5:**
    - Consecutive hits can break guard or interrupt abilities (after 4 succesfull hits cant attack this round)
        

### **Limitations**

- Requires continuous aggression; momentum resets if user disengages
