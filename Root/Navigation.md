**Type:** Passive — Sailor Pathway / Environmental Mastery

**Description:**  
The user possesses a scholar’s intuition for astronomy, geography, and maritime phenomena. They can sense magnetic fields, ocean currents, wind direction, and cloud patterns instinctively. Combined with expert sailing skills, this allows precise travel, situational awareness, and environmental adaptation.

**Effects:**

- Perfect navigation at sea; boats with the Sailor onboard never get lost
    
- Advantage on survival, navigation, and environmental perception checks
    
- Can accurately judge distances and trajectories, enabling precise long-range throws or attacks even without direct sight
    
- Enhanced situational awareness in stormy, foggy, or chaotic environments
    

⚠ **Warning:** Mastery over navigation does not prevent sudden disasters — storms, tides, or supernatural interference may still threaten the vessel or crew.
