**Type:** Passive — Psychological Suppression / Command Presence  
**Pathway:** Arbiter  
**Sequence:** (Base Passive of the Pathway)

### **Description**

Arbiters naturally emanate a commanding presence known as **Authority**.  
This is not mere charisma, but a metaphysical reinforcement of status and legitimacy. Their words carry weight beyond rhetoric, subtly influencing cognition and emotional state.

Authority manifests as a field-like psychological pressure centered on the Arbiter.

### **Core Effects**

**1. Command Reinforcement**

- Statements and directives are more readily believed.
    
- Orders feel inherently reasonable or justified.
    
- Targets experience increased inclination to comply.
    

**2. Conflict Aura**

- In direct opposition, enemies may experience:
    
    - Reduced morale
        
    - Lower aggression threshold
        
    - Subconscious desire to yield or disengage
        


### **Operational Characteristics**

- Stronger against individuals with weak willpower or unstable mental states.
    
- Less effective against high-Sequence Beyonders or trained mental specialists.
    
- Does not function as absolute mind control — resistance is possible through willpower or counteracting abilities.
    

### **Scaling Principle**

Authority strengthens with:

- Higher Sequence advancement
    
- Personal conviction and decisiveness
    
- Clear hierarchical positioning (e.g., lawful setting, courtroom, battlefield command)
    

In structured environments where rules or law are acknowledged, Authority becomes significantly more potent.
