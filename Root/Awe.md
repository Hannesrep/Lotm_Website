**Type:** Active — Psychological / Presence Aura  
**Spell Cost:** Level 2 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 10-meter radius (centered on user)  
**Duration:** 2 rounds (Seq 7), 3 rounds (Seq 6), 4 rounds (Seq 5)

**Description:**  
The user releases an overwhelming aura reminiscent of a dragon’s presence — ancient, dominant, and terrifying. Those who witness it feel instinctive fear and mental pressure, causing hesitation, confusion, and loss of composure. Rather than dealing damage, Awe disrupts enemy focus and weakens their ability to act effectively.

### **Core Mechanics**

- All hostile creatures within range must make a Wisdom / Mental Resistance save
    
- On failure:
    
    - Target becomes **Frightened and Mentally Confused**
        
    - Suffers **Disadvantage on attack rolls, perception checks, and mental saves**
        
    - Cannot willingly move closer to the user
        
- On success:
    
    - Target resists fear but still suffers **Disadvantage on next action** due to pressure
        

### **Limitations**

- Ineffective against mindless entities or creatures immune to fear
    
- Allies must be prepared; untrained allies may need to make minor resistance checks (GM optional)
    
- Requires visible presence; cannot be used while hidden
