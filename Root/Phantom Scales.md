**Type:** Passive — Spiritual Defense / Sailor Pathway

**Description:**  
The user develops faint, semi-spiritual scales that exist between the physical and spiritual layer. These phantom scales reduce incoming damage and provide natural resistance against environmental and supernatural threats, especially those tied to storms, water, and physical force. The protection manifests instinctively when danger approaches rather than as visible armor.

**Effects:**

- Passive damage reduction against physical attacks (-2 dmg)
    
- Increased resistance vs cold water, pressure, and storm-related hazards
    
- Cannot be removed or disarmed — always active
