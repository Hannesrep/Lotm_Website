**Type:** Active — Mental Domination / Beast Control  
**Pathway:** Beast Tamer  
**Sequence:** 8  
**Activation:** Action (Eye Contact Required)  
**Range:** 20 meters (line of sight)  
**Duration:** Gradual (Taming requires repeated exposure; control persists while bonded)

**Description:**  
At Sequence 8, a Beast Tamer possesses an overwhelming predatory aura and heightened spiritual dominance over animals. Through eye contact and focused intent, they can **read the surface thoughts of beasts, share sensory perception, communicate simple commands, and forcibly suppress hostile instincts**.

Animals instinctively perceive the Beast Tamer as a superior predator. Most creatures will hesitate, submit, or flee upon direct eye contact.

### **Core Abilities**

**1. Animal Senses**

- Read simple emotional states and surface thoughts (fear, hunger, aggression).
    
- Temporarily perceive through an animal’s senses (sight, hearing, smell).
    
- Communication is instinctive and conceptual rather than verbal.
    

**2. Suppression & Intimidation**

- Eye contact forces weaker animals to freeze or retreat.
    
- Hostile beasts must succeed on a Will/Instinct check or become submissive.
    
- Natural animals treat the Beast Tamer as an apex predator.
    

**3. Gradual Taming**

- Repeated interaction allows a beast to become permanently loyal.
    
- A tamed animal acts as an assistant and follows mental commands.
    
- Complex commands require stronger bonding.
    

### **Limitations**

- Effective only on natural animals (not magical beasts unless weakened).
    
- Intelligent or spiritually strong creatures may resist.
    
- Initial domination requires eye contact and focus.
    
- Only a limited number of beasts can be deeply bonded at one time (GM discretion).
