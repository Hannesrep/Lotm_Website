_(Upgrade of Sun Halo)_  
**Type:** Active — Radiant Aura / Purification Field  
**Pathway:** Sun / Bard → Higher Sequence  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** Self (15feet)  
**Duration:** Concentration / Scene-based

**Description:**  
Light of Purification manifests as an intense solar halo that actively burns corruption, dispels negative influences, and stabilizes allies. Unlike the basic Sun Halo, this radiance does not only inspire — it **cleanses**. Corrupted entities feel constant spiritual pressure while allies gain resilience and clarity.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Allies inside aura:
    
    - Advantage on saves vs corruption, fear, madness
        
    - Minor regeneration or spiritual stabilization (+10 health?, maybe get one lvl 1 and lvl 2 spell slot back? GM desides :) )
        
    - Ongoing negative effects weakened or suppressed
        
- Enemies inside aura:
    - Disadvantage on corruption-based abilities
        
    - Weak shadow constructs begin to dissolve
