**Type:** Active — Physical Empowerment / Dawn Paladin  
**Availability:** Seq 6–5  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Duration:** 4 Combat turns

**Description:**  
The Paladin unleashes giant-like physical power, massively enhancing strength, speed, endurance, and combat performance. Their presence becomes overwhelming, and their attacks generate powerful shockwaves.

### **Effects**

- Massive increase in physical strength and stamina (+5?)
    
- Burst movement speed comparable to a steam-train charge (movement does dmg = strenght, can move in straight line, can ovepower terrain effects (ex: fire))
    
- Multiple powerful strikes without fatigue (can do two short range attacks)
    
- Weapon swings create gusts that destabilize enemies (missed attacks can destabilize)
    

**Limitations:**

- Post-ability exhaustion (fatigue after duration ends)(last in initiative)
    
- Does not increase resistance to high-level conceptual or mental attacks
