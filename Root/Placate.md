**Type:** Active — Mental Stabilization / Emotional Control 
**Spell Cost:** Level 2 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 10 ft
**Duration:** Instant effect + lingering calm

**Description:**  
Placate allows the user to calm emotional turbulence, suppress psychological instability, and temporarily stabilize corrupted or mentally compromised individuals. By projecting a soothing mental presence, the user reduces aggression, panic, and the influence of corruption or external mental interference. While primarily a non-combat ability, it can be used during combat to neutralize hostile intent or prevent escalation.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Target makes a Wisdom / Mental Resistance save (optional for willing targets)
    
- On success or willing target:
    
    - Emotional instability and panic are reduced
        
    - Corruption influence is **temporarily suppressed**
        
    - Target gains Advantage on saves against fear, madness, or corruption effects

### **Anti-Corruption Effects**

- Temporarily stabilizes individuals affected by **mental corruption or spiritual contamination**
    
- Slows progression of corruption effects for the duration
    
- Allows corrupted targets a new saving throw against ongoing mental influence
    
- Does **not remove corruption permanently**, only suppresses or stabilizes it

### **Limitations**

- Cannot fully cleanse corruption — only suppress or stabilize
    
- Less effective against entities fully consumed by madness
