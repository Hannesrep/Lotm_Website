**Type:** Passive — Mental Instability / Curse Manifestation  
**Pathway:** Lunatic  
**Sequence:** 8

---

### **Description**

Beginning at Sequence 8, the Lunatic becomes subject to a persistent metaphysical affliction known as the **Lunatic’s Curse**.

This Curse erodes mental stability and lowers the threshold at which the Lunatic may lose control. Compared to other Beyonders of the same Sequence, their psyche is significantly more fragile under emotional stress, spiritual turbulence, or excessive use of their powers.

- Lowered resistance to psychological destabilization.
    
- Higher probability of involuntary partial loss of control when:
    
    - Overusing abilities
        
    - Suffering heavy spiritual damage
        
    - Experiencing intense emotional triggers
        
- Berserk is easier to enter — but also harder to suppress if triggered unintentionally.
