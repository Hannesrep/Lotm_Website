**Type:** Active — Spiritual Ritual Casting  
**Cost:** 1+ Spell Slots depending on ritual complexity + required materials  
**Activation:** 5 minutes – several hours (ritual dependent)

**Description:**  
Ritualistic Magic allows the user to produce supernatural effects through structured ceremonies, symbolic actions, offerings, and communication with the spirit world or higher entities. Unlike instant abilities, rituals rely on preparation, correct procedures, and spiritual resonance.

Rituals may be used to request knowledge, protection, concealment, healing, summoning assistance, creating wards, or influencing fate. The strength and reliability of rituals depend on the user’s Sequence, mental stability, materials used, and environmental conditions.

Improper rituals can attract unwanted attention or produce unintended consequences.
