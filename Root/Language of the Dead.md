**Type:** Active — Spirit Attack / Corpse Collector  
**Pathway:** Spirit Medium  
**Availability:** Seq 6–5  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** 20–30 meters (line of sight or spiritual perception)  
**Duration:** Instant / Concentration (for ongoing effects)

**Description:**  
By speaking a mystical language, the user can **force a target’s Spirit to partially leave its body**, bypassing the protections of flesh and blood. This allows the Medium to directly interact with the Spirit Body to disrupt, immobilize, or weaken the target without enslaving it.

⚠ _“The language reaches the soul, ignoring the mortal shell.”_

### **Mechanics**

- Seq 6: Target must make a Wisdom or Constitution save (GM discretion) or suffer partial Spirit disconnection — penalties to attacks, movement, or defenses for 1 round
    
- Seq 5: Stronger effect — target’s Spirit is partially forced out for multiple rounds, reducing effectiveness and increasing vulnerability to Spirit attacks
    
- Can be used offensively to debilitate spirits inside corpses, undead, or even living Beyonders with strong Spirituality
    

**Limitations:**

- Requires line of sight or knowledge of target’s location
    
- Powerful or resistant spirits can partially resist, mitigating the effect
    
- Does **not** grant permanent control or enslavement; purely an attack/disruption
