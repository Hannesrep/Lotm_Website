**Type:** Active — Mental Concealment  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** Self  
**Duration:** requires full focus

**Description:**  
The user hides within the blind spot of another’s consciousness, erasing their psychological presence rather than physically disappearing. Targets simply fail to register the user’s existence even when looking directly at them. This concealment bypasses normal perception, Spirit Vision, and danger intuition unless the user directly interferes in an obvious way.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Targets cannot consciously perceive or remember the user
    
- Spirit Vision and intuition usually do not trigger
    
- The user may move, observe, and prepare actions unnoticed
    
- Strong environmental interaction or direct aggression can break the effect
    

### **Limitations**

- Requires constant mental focus
    
- Loud noise or strong physical interaction can break concealment
    
- Does not make actions invisible — only removes awareness of the user
