**Type:** Passive — Aura / Psychological Effect

**Description:**  
The user emanates an aura of gloom and cold, lowering their body temperature and giving off a morbid, unsettling presence. This passive effect instinctively deters hostile spirits and undead from attacking, as they perceive the Corpse Collector as a non-living or unappealing target.

**Effects:**

- Undead and spirits are less likely to target the user automatically
    
- Passive intimidation / psychological effect on enemies within 10 meters
    
- Can be combined with other Corpse Collector abilities for defensive synergy
    
- Always active; no activation cost
    

⚠ **Warning:** While this deters undead, it does not stop attacks from living enemies. The aura can make social interactions with non-undead unsettling.
