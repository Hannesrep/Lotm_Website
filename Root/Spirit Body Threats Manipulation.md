**Type:** Active — Control / Spiritual Domination  
**Requirement:** Seer Pathway — **Sequence 5**  
**Cost:** 1 Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Activation:** Action — Sustained 

**Description:**  
The user manifests invisible spiritual threads that attach to a target’s spirit body, gradually restricting movement and weakening autonomy. Over time, these threads infiltrate deeper into the target’s spiritual structure, slowing reactions and eventually allowing complete control. The process is gradual and requires continuous focus.

This ability prepares the target for full **Possession**, but does not grant immediate control.

### **Effect Progression (Example — GM may adjust timing)**

**Stage 1 — Initial Binding**

- Target’s Initiative decreases
    
- Target acts **last** in combat order
    
- Minor movement reduction
    
- Target senses unnatural resistance
    

**Stage 2 — Deep Control**

- Disadvantage on Dexterity or reaction-based actions
    
- Reduced movement speed
    
- Increased difficulty resisting manipulation
    
- Visible signs of spiritual interference
    

**Stage 3 — Full Thread Control**

- Target becomes fully bound by Spirit Body Threads
    
- Target is eligible for **Possess** ability
    
- Target may struggle mentally but loses physical autonomy
    

### **Limitations**

- Requires sustained concentration
    
- Strong-willed or high-sequence targets resist longer
    
- Only one fully controlled target at a time (GM discretion)
    


### **Drawbacks & Risks**

- Mental strain increases over time
    
- Spiritual backlash if threads are forcefully severed
    
- High-level entities may trace the threads back to the user
    
- Emotional instability may disrupt thread control
