**Type:** Active — Transformation / Mobility / Regeneration  
**Pathway:** Scarlet Scholar  
**Activation:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Requires Moonlight in area  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Description:**  
Under Moonlight, the Scarlet Scholar can transform into a condensed, pale-red **Spectral Moonlight Form** — becoming semi-ethereal and composed of lunar essence.

Their body dissolves into hazy red-tinted Moonlight fragments and can reform elsewhere within Moonlit areas.


## **Effects**

- Becomes partially intangible (non-magical attacks pass through or deal reduced damage).
    
- Can move rapidly between Moonlit areas.
    
- If shattered, can reconstruct instantly in another Moonlit location within range.
    
- Gains resistance to physical and elemental damage.
    


## **Critical Weakness**

While in Spectral Moonlight Form:

- The only reliable way to inflict lethal damage is to **strike the heart directly** with a sufficiently powerful attack.
    
- Heart-targeted purification or anti-lunar attacks can bypass regeneration.
    

## **Flash (Moonlight Teleportation)**

While Moonlight shines on a location, the Scarlet Scholar may:

- Instantly teleport to another Moonlit spot within a moderate radius.
    
- This can be used repeatedly, limited by Spirituality reserves.
