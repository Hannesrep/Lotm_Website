**Duration:** Instant / Short 

**Description:**  
Ocean Songsters can manipulate **lightning and sound** as extensions of their body. These abilities combine elemental power, precision, and vocal resonance, allowing devastating attacks, paralyzing strikes, or influence over enemies’ minds.

## **1. Lightning Strikes (Thunder Strike)**

**Effect:**

- Produces silver-white electric light capable of **paralysis**
    
- Contains **Purification properties**, effective against undead or evil spirits
    
- Can be infused into weapons (bullets, daggers) to enhance attacks
    

**Mechanics:**

- Deals lightning + radiant damage (Seq 5: 4d12)
    
- Targets must make a Constitution save or be paralyzed for 1 round
    
- Secondary effect: spreads minor lightning to 1–2 adjacent conductive targets (GM discretion)
    

## **2. Lightning Arrows (Lightning Bolt Arrow)**

**Effect:**

- Condenses lightning into an arrow using a bow or throw it (GM discretion)
    

**Mechanics:**

- Ranged attack (Seq 5: 4d12 lightning damage)
    
- Can strike multiple conductive targets if they are close
    
- Visually dramatic: silver-white lightning trails the projectile
    

**Limitations:**

- Requires a bow or arrow-like medium
    

## **3. Siren Song**

**Effect:**

- Influences enemies or enhances own power using the voice
    
- Can induce **trance, absent-mindedness, fear, or irritability**
    
- Can simulate thunder to intimidate or amplify own explosive effects
    
- Works even on deaf targets due to spiritual-level resonance
    

**Mechanics:**

- Targets must make Wisdom save or suffer one of the following (GM chooses( depends on the song)):
    
    - Trance / confusion / absent-mindedness
        
    - Irritability / lowered mental resistance
        
    - Disadvantage on attacks or checks for 1 round
        
- Can also enhance own next attack damage (+2d6 lightning, Seq 5)
    

**Limitations:**
    
- Range limited by line of spiritual perception, not just hearing (~30–50m)
    
- Effects vary slightly depending on the Songster’s traits (singing skills :) )
    

### **General Notes**

- Lightning effects can be channeled through weapons, arrows, or directly from body/voice
    
- All abilities at Seq 5 are **instant and highly destructive**; minor environmental effects may result

⚠ **Warning:** Ocean Songster power is volatile — misuse or loss of control can harm allies or themselves.
