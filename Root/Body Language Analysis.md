**Type:** Active — Cognitive / Behavioral Analysis  
**Pathway:** Spectator  
**Spell Cost:** 1 Level 1 Spell Slot _(Seq 9–7)_ / 1 Level 2 Spell Slot _(Seq 6–5)_  
**Activation:** Action — Sustained Observation (line of sight required)  
**Range:** Visual

**Description:**  
Body Language Analysis allows the user to observe micro-expressions, posture shifts, breathing patterns, and unconscious movements to infer emotions, intentions, and psychological states. As the Spectator advances, the analysis evolves from simple emotional reading to predictive behavioral modeling and manipulation awareness.

### **Effects by Sequence**

### 🔹 **Sequence 9 — Emotional Reading**

- Detect basic emotional states (fear, anger, confidence, stress)
    
- Advantage on Insight checks during conversations
    
- Notice hesitation or nervous intent before actions
    

### 🔹 **Sequence 8 — Intent Detection**

- Predict immediate hostile or deceptive intent
    
- Gain +2 Initiative vs observed target
    
- Advantage against surprise attacks from observed target
    
- Detect basic lies through behavioral inconsistencies
    

### 🔹 **Sequence 7 — Behavioral Prediction**

- Predict next likely physical action (attack, flee, defend)
    
- Once per activation: impose disadvantage on target’s first attack
    
- Detect social manipulation or hidden tension within groups
    

### 🔹 **Sequence 6 — Psychological Profiling**

- Identify fears, triggers, and mental weaknesses
    
- Gain advantage on social manipulation or intimidation
    
- Reduce target’s deception effectiveness
    
- Once per activation: force target to reroll a successful social action
    

### 🔹 **Sequence 5 — Predictive Cognition**

- Read combat patterns and behavioral loops
    
- Target suffers −2 Initiative and disadvantage on feints
    
- User may predict one action per turn (GM confirmation)
    
- Reveal hidden motives or long-term intentions through analysis
    


### **Limitations**

- Requires clear visual observation
    
- Unpredictable or chaotic entities reduce effectiveness
    
- Emotionless constructs or mindless creatures resist analysis
    

### **Drawbacks & Risks**

- Over-interpretation may lead to false conclusions (GM discretion)
    
- High-level mental concealment may reflect misleading signals
