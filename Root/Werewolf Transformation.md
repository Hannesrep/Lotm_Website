### **Description**

At Sequence 7, the Beyonder gains the ability to transform into a **Werewolf**, manifesting erect coarse fur, elongated claws, sharpened fangs, and a monstrous physique.

This transformation drastically enhances all physical attributes and grants access to several Spell-like abilities.

Partial transformations are possible, allowing selective manifestation of claws, fangs, or other traits without entering full beast form.

- Agility surpassing natural predators (can outrun a gray wolf at full sprint).
    
- Extreme durability and combat resilience.
    

**2. Natural Weapons**

- Claws and fangs equivalent to **Beyonder weapons of Sequence 7**.
    
- Capable of shredding thinner steel plates.

## **Partial Transformation**

The Werewolf may selectively manifest:

- Claws only
    
- Fangs only
    
- Heightened senses
    
- Muscular enhancement
    

This allows tactical flexibility without full Spiritual expenditure.

# **Spell-like Abilities**

### **Werewolf Kin**

If the Werewolf’s venom remains within a target long enough:

- The target transforms into a temporary wolf-like puppet.
    
- The creature falls under the Werewolf’s control.
    
- Lifespan of created kin is short and unstable.
    

This ability requires sustained venom infiltration and is not instantaneous.

---

### **Darkness Encroachment**

The Werewolf thickens surrounding Darkness, causing it to condense and seep into the target’s body.

**Effects:**

- Induces primal, uncontrollable fear.
    
- Impairs rational thinking and movement.
    
- Causes mild physical debilitation.
    

Effect strengthens in dark environments.

---

## **Weakness**

- Highly vulnerable to **Sun-domain and theurgical abilities**.
    
- Holy Light and purification spells significantly suppress regeneration.
    
- Solar-aligned attacks deal amplified damage.
