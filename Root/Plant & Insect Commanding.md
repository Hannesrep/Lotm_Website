**Type:** Active — Natural Dominion  
**Pathway:** Harvest Priest  
**Sequence:** 7–5  
**Activation:** Action  
**Range:** 30 m (Seq 7) → 50 m (Seq 6) → 80 m (Seq 5)  
**Duration:** Concentration (up to several minutes)

**Prerequisites:**

- Target must lack higher intelligence.
    
- Commands cannot exceed biological limitations of the species.
    

**Description:**  
The Harvest Priest can command unintelligent plants and insects within range, directing their natural behaviors to provide support, obstruction, or harassment.

### Sequence Scaling

**Sequence 7**

- Commands small groups of insects or localized plant growth.
    
- Plants may bend, entangle lightly, or obstruct movement.
    
- Insects can swarm to distract or mildly harm targets.
    

**Sequence 6**

- Controls large swarms and multiple plant clusters simultaneously.
    
- Plants can coordinate to restrain or impede multiple enemies.
    
- Insect swarms become aggressive and tactically disruptive.
    

**Sequence 5**

- Exerts dominant control over all qualifying plants and insects in range.
    
- Can orchestrate large-scale swarms for sustained assault.
    
- Vegetation acts in coordinated patterns for containment, pursuit, or protection.
    
- Control becomes instinctive and near-simultaneous across the entire area.
