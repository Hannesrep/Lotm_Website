**Pathway:** Conspirer  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** Up to 10 meters initially (increases with Sequence and potion digestion)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Description:**  
Conspirers can merge with flames they conjure or control, traveling instantaneously to the point of the flame. This includes fire weapons or projectiles generated via Pyrokinesis. Allies may be transported if carried.

**Effect:**

- Instant movement to the landing point of a fire-based attack or spell
    
- Can take 1–2 willing targets (Seq 7–8)
    
- Provides tactical repositioning, escape, or surprise entry into combat
    

**Mechanics:**

- Movement speed: Instantaneous within Range
    
- Can merge with active flame objects (fireballs, enchanted weapons)
    
- Fire damage avoided by merging with flames, but carrying others may expose them to minor fire damage (Seq 7: 1d6, Seq 8: 2d6)
    

**Limitations:**

- Cannot merge with non-fire elemental objects
    
- Range limited by control of Pyrokinesis and Sequence
    
- Requires conscious activation; cannot move spontaneously
