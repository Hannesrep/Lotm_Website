**Type:** Passive — Physiological Enhancement  
**Pathway:** Apothecary

**Description:**  
Through constant exposure to herbs, venoms, toxins, and alchemical substances, the Apothecary’s body undergoes gradual adaptation. Their metabolism becomes highly efficient at **neutralizing, filtering, and breaking down poisonous elements**, granting them natural resistance to toxins.

### **Effects**

- Reduced damage from poisons and toxic substances.
    
- Increased resistance against paralysis, nausea, and toxin-induced weakness.
    
- Slower onset and shortened duration of poison effects.
    
- Improved tolerance to experimental alchemical substances.
    

### **Limitations**

- Does not grant immunity. Extremely potent, supernatural, or divine poisons can still affect them.
    
- Continuous high-dose exposure may still overwhelm their system.
    
- Does not protect against diseases unless toxin-based.
