**Type:** Passive — Cognitive / Perceptive Trait

**Description:**  
The user possesses heightened awareness and exceptional attention to detail. Subtle movements, concealed objects, behavioral inconsistencies, and environmental clues are noticed almost instinctively. This ability greatly enhances situational awareness and works in strong synergy with **Theft**, allowing the user to identify potential targets and opportunities more efficiently.

In addition, the user may actively scan a nearby person for valuables through careful observation and instinctive analysis.

**Active Scan (No Spell Slot):**

- Make an Observation/Perception roll (GM-defined stat)
    
- On success: determine whether the target carries **valuable items, hidden objects, or theft-worthy resources**
    
- Higher success may reveal approximate item value or concealment level
    
- Does not automatically grant theft — only information
    

⚠ **Warning:** A keen eye reveals opportunity — but staring too closely may also reveal your intentions.
