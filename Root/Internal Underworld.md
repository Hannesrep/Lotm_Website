**Type:** Active — Spirit/Undead Storage & Deployment / Gatekeeper  
**Pathway:** Gatekeeper  
**Availability:** Seq 6–5  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** Self-centered (internal dimension)  
**Duration:** Persistent / Until dismissed

**Description:**  
The Gatekeeper can **house numerous spirits, deceased, and natural entities within their body**, creating a miniature, hidden Underworld. This allows the user to summon an undead army or spirit allies anywhere without drawing attention.

⚠ _“My body is a gate, and my soul a city of the dead.”_

### **Mechanics**

- Store 4–6 units; stronger spirits with unique abilities (e.g., Death Envoy) can aid in combat
    
- Death Envoy effect: Causes target’s body to go numb; blood seems frozen; vitality drains over time if resisting fails (Wisdom/Constitution save)
    
- Provides strategic advantages for ambushes, reconnaissance, or battlefield control
