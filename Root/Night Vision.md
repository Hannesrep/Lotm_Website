**Type:** Passive — Sensory Enhancement

**Description:**  
The user’s eyes adapt to darkness, allowing them to see clearly in low-light environments and function effectively at night or in poorly illuminated areas. Shadows and dim surroundings no longer significantly hinder perception, enabling safe movement, awareness of threats, and reliable navigation without external light sources.

**Effects:**

- Can see normally in dim light and partially in darkness (GM defines exact range)
    
- No disadvantage on perception checks due to low-light conditions
    
- Improved detection of movement and silhouettes in dark environments
    
- Functions passively; no activation or resource cost required
