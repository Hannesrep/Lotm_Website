### **Core Mechanics**

#### **1. Spirit Channelling**

- Communicate with natural spirits and undead to **command or gather information**
    
- Seq 6: Control 1–3 spirits; Seq 5: Control 4–6 spirits simultaneously
    
- Spirits can perform simple tasks:
    
    - Frost Shadow: create frozen domains, armor-like ice, or wield frost scythes
        
    - Earth Ghost: manipulate terrain, drag targets underground
        
- Spirits can act as informants, scouting areas or alerting the Medium of danger
    

#### **2. Communication with Living Souls**

- Can attempt to communicate with living targets’ spirits to extract information
    
- Requires high Spirituality or specialized medications (e.g., Amantha Essence, Eye of the Spirit)
    
- Seq 5: More resistant souls can be influenced with prolonged focus and spiritual strength
    
- High risk: the target’s strong Spirituality may backfire if precautions are not taken
    

#### **3. Zombie Disguise**

- Allows the Medium to appear as a Zombie, reducing the effect of decay, cold, death auras
    
- Provides passive resistance against environmental and spiritual hazards
    

#### **4. Spirit Affinity**

- Deceased and natural spirits recognize the Medium as non-threatening
    
- Friendly spirits may proactively relay information or assist in tasks
    
- Seq 5: Spirit coordination improves; multiple spirits may act semi-autonomously

### **Limitations**

- Spirits require line of sight or proximity unless pre-bound or naturally present
    
- Some spirits require materials for safe channelling (e.g., full moon oil, corpse incense, Medium’s blood)
    
- Controlling spirits or living souls consumes concentration and risks spiritual backlash
    
- Cannot summon distant spirits without Ritualistic Magic; relies on local or nearby entities

### **Usage Notes**

- Versatile: combat, recon, investigation, environmental control
    
- Spirits are semi-autonomous; commands may require GM adjudication
    
- Concentration can be divided among multiple spirits depending on Sequence and Medium’s skill
    

⚠ **Warning:** Mishandling spirits—especially living ones—can result in possession, backlash, or corruption.
