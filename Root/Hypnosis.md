**Duration:** Seq dependent / concentration

**Description:**  
Hypnosis is an evolved form of Psychological Cue that allows the user to enter a target’s **Body of Heart and Mind**, influencing thoughts, memories, and behavior. It can implant suggestions subconsciously or force short-term abnormal actions during combat. Targets often remain unaware they were influenced.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Target rolls Mental Resistance / Wisdom save
    
- On failure:
    
    - Non-combat: implant commands or alter perception subconsciously
        
    - Combat: force short-term abnormal behavior (attack wrong target, hesitate, withdraw)
        
- Commands cannot directly force suicide or obvious self-destruction
    

### **Limitations**

- Strong willpower or firm identity grants resistance
    
- Directly life-threatening commands fail or break the hypnosis
    
- Combat hypnosis lasts only briefly before targets regain awareness
    

⚠ **Warning:** Do not alter minds you cannot withstand — deep hypnosis risks dragging the user into the target’s subconscious instability.
