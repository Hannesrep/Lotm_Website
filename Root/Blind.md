**Description:**  
The user releases an overwhelming burst of sacred brilliance that disrupts vision and sensory processing. Targets are temporarily blinded or disoriented by the intense solar radiance, leaving them vulnerable and unable to react properly.

### **Core Mechanics**

- Target makes Constitution or Wisdom save
    
- On failure:
    
    - Blinded or heavily disoriented
        
    - Disadvantage on attacks and perception
        
    - Reduced movement accuracy
        
- On success: partial impairment (disadvantage on next action)
    

⚠ **Warning:** The Sun burns without discrimination — allies caught in the radiance may suffer as well.
