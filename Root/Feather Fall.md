**Type:** Passive — Mobility Adaptation / Assassin

**Description:**  
Assassins can lighten their bodies at will, allowing them to descend safely from great heights and move with near-weightless agility.

**Effects:**

- Safe landing from extreme heights (≈6 floors or equivalent)
    
- Reduced fall damage significantly or completely (GM system scaling)
    
- Ability to glide short distances during descent
    
- Improved aerial control while jumping or falling
    

⚠ _Does not allow true flight — only controlled descent and mobility._
