**Type:** Passive — Lunar Curse / Instinct Amplification  
**Pathway:** Werewolf  
**Sequence:** 7

---

### **Description**

Beginning at Sequence 7, the Werewolf becomes bound to a lunar affliction known as the **Werewolf’s Curse**.

During every **Full Moon**, their beastly nature surges uncontrollably. The curse temporarily destabilizes their sanity and amplifies predatory instincts to dangerous levels.

---

### **Full Moon Effects**

- Partial involuntary transformation (black fur manifestation).
    
- Bloodlust and killing intent peak dramatically.
    
- Emotional restraint significantly weakened.
    
- Increased aggression and impulsiveness.
    

Even outside full transformation, their aura becomes more feral and oppressive.

---

### **Psychological Degradation**

If a Werewolf repeatedly fails to suppress their murderous instincts during Full Moon periods:

- Emotional detachment increases.
    
- Empathy gradually erodes.
    
- Personality becomes colder, more ruthless, and twisted.
    
- Long-term loss of humanity may occur.
    

This degradation is progressive and cumulative.

---

### **Mitigation Methods**

- Strong willpower and mental discipline can partially resist the effects.
    
- Certain Sealed Artifacts aligned with the **Moon domain** (particularly those corresponding to a Scarlet Scholar) can preserve rationality during Full Moon periods.
    
- Similar lunar-triggered curses affect Zombies and Wraiths, and such artifacts may suppress those as well.

### **Balance Consideration**

- The Curse cannot be permanently removed at this Sequence.
    
- Suppression reduces instability but does not eliminate the lunar amplification entirely.
