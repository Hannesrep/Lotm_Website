**Type:** Active — Growth Manipulation / Battlefield Control   
**Sequence:** 7–5  
**Activation:** Action (Touch or Ground Contact)  
**Range:** 30 m (Seq 7) → 50 m (Seq 6) → 80 m (Seq 5)  
**Duration:** Instant Growth; Vegetation persists naturally

**Description:**  
Through this ability, the Harvest Priest catalyzes the latent life force within seeds and plants, accelerating growth far beyond natural limits. This can be done through direct contact or by channeling vitality into the surrounding earth.

### Sequence Scaling

**Sequence 7**

- Rapidly matures seeds held in hand within seconds.
    
- Creates thorned vines capable of restraining 1–2 targets.
    
- Ground activation accelerates existing vegetation but does not cause explosive growth.
    
- Can mildly stimulate or weaken plant-like creatures through touch.
    

**Sequence 6**

- Simultaneously catalyzes multiple seeds.
    
- Generates dense vine fields for area denial.
    
- Mutated plant seeds become tactically dangerous (poisonous, hardened, entangling).
    
- Ground activation significantly thickens and expands vegetation.
    
- Can force rapid maturation or exhaustion in plant-like entities.
    

**Sequence 5**

- Mass catalyzation within full range; vegetation can overtake a battlefield in seconds.
    
- Vines gain high tensile strength and coordinated constriction.
    
- Mutated flora becomes offensively lethal.
    
- Can forcibly accelerate a plant-like creature’s life cycle to critical instability.
