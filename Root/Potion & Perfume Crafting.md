**Type:** Active — Alchemical Creation / Mystical Item Fabrication  
**Pathway:** Potion Professor  
**Sequence:** 6  
**Activation:** Preparation (varies from minutes to hours)  
**Range:** Consumable / Applied Item  
**Duration:** Varies by formula

**Description:**  
With their evolved alchemical mastery, Potion Professors can craft **Potions and Perfumes with extraordinary, near-mystical effects**.

These creations function similarly to Mystical Items —  
however, they **do not contain Beyonder Characteristics** and therefore have **expiration dates**.

A well-prepared Potion Professor who has pre-consumed specific countermeasures is extremely difficult to defeat.
