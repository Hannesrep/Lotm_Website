**Type:** Passive — Mental / Existential Influence  
**Pathway:** Mystery Pryer  
**Activation:** Automatic / Uncontrolled  
**Duration:** Random Intervals

**Description:**  
Mystery Pryers are pursued by living knowledge. Occult truths, forbidden insights, and fragmented revelations force themselves into the Pryer’s mind unpredictably.

**Effect:**

- Random bursts of knowledge or revelation
    
- May grant temporary insight (advantage on Arcana/Occult checks)
    
- Risk of mental instability or Corruption
    

**Mechanics:**

- At GM discretion, roll 1d6 during critical moments:
    
    - 1–2: Mental backlash (disadvantage 1 round)
        
    - 3–4: No effect
        
    - 5–6: Gain advantage on next knowledge-based roll
        

**Special:**

- Influence from hidden entities may alter outcome
    
- Excessive exposure increases risk of loss of control
