**Description:**  
Dream Traversal allows the user to enter the **collective dream layer** and move through interconnected dreamscapes instead of physical space. By stepping into dreams, the user can travel unseen between sleeping individuals, bypassing physical barriers and surveillance. The user exists as a semi-spiritual presence while traversing, vulnerable to strong spiritual interference and dream predators.


### **Core Mechanics**

- User enters the Dream World and becomes intangible to the physical world
    
- Can move between dreams of sleeping targets within range
    
- Can exit through another dream to reappear in the physical world near that sleeper
    

### **Limitations**

- Requires nearby sleeping minds as anchors
    
- Strong spiritual zones or sealed areas may block traversal
    
- Damage taken in dreams equals real harm
