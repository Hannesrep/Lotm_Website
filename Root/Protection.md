**Type:** Active — Defensive Stance / Guardian (Dawn Pathway)  
**Availability:** Seq 6–5  
**Spell Cost:** Level 3 Spell Slot  
**Range:** ~10–15 meters (ally protection radius)  
**Duration:** Concentration / Stance-based

**Description:**  
By kneeling and planting their greatsword before them, the Guardian summons invisible Dawn-forged barriers to the left and right, creating a defensive formation capable of shielding allies. While fully committed to defense, the Guardian becomes an immovable bulwark capable of absorbing immense damage meant for companions.

⚠ _“Stand behind me. Nothing passes.”_

### **Effects**

- Creates two invisible Dawn barriers forming a protected defensive zone (hard to outmaneovre)
    
- Guardian can redirect or absorb damage intended for allies inside the radius (half)
    
- Massive resistance to physical, elemental, and many supernatural damage types while in full defensive stance 
    
- Enemies below High-Sequence struggle heavily to break through the defense
    

### **Stance Rules**

- While **fully defending**, offense is restricted (limited attacks or none — GM discretion)
    
- If the Guardian attacks, their defensive power is significantly reduced but remains extremely high
    
- Movement is limited while the stance is active
    

### **Limitations**

- Certain elite abilities (e.g., Reaper-type penetration attacks) can partially bypass defenses
    
- Requires planted weapon and grounded stance (if lifted etc stance breaks)
    

⚠ **Warning:** Absolute defense demands absolute commitment — abandoning protection mid-attack may expose both the Guardian and their allies to sudden danger.
