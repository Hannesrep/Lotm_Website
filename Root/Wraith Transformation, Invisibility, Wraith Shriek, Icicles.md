**Pathway:** Wraith  
**Sequence:** 7

### **Description**

At Sequence 7, a Wraith is able to fully manifest their Spirit Body, blending flesh and spirit, and gaining extraordinary resilience, mobility, and spectral abilities. Their existence allows them to interact with both the material and Spirit Worlds in ways mortals cannot.

## **1. Wraith Transformation**

**Effect:**

- Turns the user into a Spirit Body, becoming intangible to most physical attacks.
    
- Can survive without a head or vital organs temporarily.
    
- Gains flight, phasing through walls, and enhanced dark vision.
    
- Resistant to fire, poison, biological attacks, and most conventional weapons.
    
- Weak to **Purification powers** and select Mystical Items (e.g., Sealed Artifacts, Demon-Hunting tools).
    

**Mechanics:**

- Fully intangible, cannot be harmed by regular weapons.
    
- Temporary resistance to psychic attacks; attacks can reflect on weaker opponents.
    
- Can traverse Spirit World and material world freely.

## **2. Invisibility**

**Effect:**

- Turns the Wraith nearly undetectable to Low–Mid Sequence Beyonders.
    
- More effective than typical spirit invisibility.
    
- Cannot hide scent; Potions Professors may detect.
    
- Spirit Threads remain visible to Marionettists.
    

**Mechanics:**

- Advantage on Stealth checks vs. most Beyonders.
    
- Detection possible only by high-level Spiritual Perception or specialized abilities.

## **3. Wraith Shriek**

**Effect:**

- Emits a sharp spiritual shriek that directly damages opponents’ Spirit Bodies.
    
- Can induce pain, stun, or temporary unconsciousness depending on target’s resilience.
    

**Mechanics:**

- Area-of-effect attack.
    
- Targets must make a Spirit Resistance/Will check or suffer:
    
    - Minor: Disruption / Stagger
        
    - Moderate: Stun for 1 round
        
    - Severe: Knocked unconscious

## **4. Icicles**

**Effect:**

- Can manipulate ice and frost around them, forming icicles from thin air.
    
- Icicles can restrain targets or act as weapons for piercing attacks.
    

**Mechanics:**

- Can target up to 1–3 enemies in melee or ranged distance.
    
- Each icicle inflicts 3d10 cold damage (Seq 7 scaling).
    
- Targets hit must make Dexterity or Constitution check to avoid being **restrained** by frozen formation.

### **General Notes**

- **Mirror Blink / Mirror Flash:** Teleports using reflections; max range 300 meters.
    
- **Spirit Possession:** Can possess living or dead bodies while remaining fully capable of using other abilities.
    
- **Entanglement of Wraiths:** Can summon undead to immobilize targets; effect depends on summoned type.
    

⚠ **Warning:** Prolonged Spirit Body form risks permanent detachment from the material world. Misuse of Spirit Possession can cause corruption or backlash.
