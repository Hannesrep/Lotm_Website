**Type:** Active — Transformation / Deception  
**Requirement:** Seer Pathway — **Sequence 6+**  
**Cost:** 1 Level 2 Spell Slot 
**Activation:** 1 Action — Sustained

**Description:**  
Shapeshifting allows a Seer to alter their physical appearance and presence through spiritual manipulation and symbolic transformation. The user may mimic other humanoids or adjust their own features to conceal identity, infiltrate groups, or manipulate perception. The transformation is both physical and spiritual in nature, making it difficult to detect through normal observation.

The effectiveness, realism, and depth of the transformation depend on the user’s Sequence.

### **Capabilities by Sequence**

**Sequence 6 — Controlled Transformation**

- Change facial features, body shape, voice, and physical traits
    
- Mimic known humanoids of similar size and structure (for detailed mimic need information)
    
- Gain advantage on deception or disguise-related checks
    
- Basic spiritual aura masking
    

**Sequence 5 — Deep Mimicry**

- Fully replicate appearance, voice patterns, posture, and mannerisms (requires target analysis before)
    
- Imitate spiritual presence and aura signatures
    
- Maintain transformation for extended durations
    
- Minor biological adjustments (height variance, muscle tone, superficial injuries)
    

### **Limitations**

- Cannot copy unique supernatural abilities of the target
    
- Requires prior observation or knowledge of the target form
    
- Extreme body size differences are not possible
    
- High-sequence entities or strong Spirit Vision may detect inconsistencies
    

### **Drawbacks & Risks**

- Extended transformations may cause identity strain or mental fatigue
    
- Emotional instability may cause momentary form distortions
    
- Failure under pressure may partially reveal the true form
    
- Repeated deep mimicry risks confusion between real and adopted identity (GM discretion)
    

⚠ **Warning:** When you wear too many faces, even your own reflection may stop recognizing you.
