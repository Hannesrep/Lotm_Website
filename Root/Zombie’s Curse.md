**Type:** Passive — Undead Hunger / Lunar Agony  
**Pathway:** Zombie  
**Sequence:** 7

### **Description**

Upon advancing to Sequence 7, the former Lunatic and Werewolf curses are replaced by a new and more oppressive affliction: the **Zombie’s Curse**.

The Zombie develops an overwhelming thirst for **warm human blood and fresh flesh**. This craving is not merely psychological — it is metaphysical, rooted in their corrupted vitality.

---

## **Baseline Effects**

- Persistent predatory hunger directed specifically toward humans.
    
- Heightened sensitivity to the scent of blood and life force.
    
- Increased agitation when exposed to fresh wounds or human vitality.
    

Unlike a Werewolf’s impulsive frenzy, this hunger is cold, constant, and gnawing.

## **Full Moon Amplification**

When the Full Moon shines:

- Cravings intensify drastically.
    
- Severe internal pain manifests if the hunger is forcibly suppressed.
    
- Prolonged resistance causes crippling agony.
    
- If self-control is maintained too long, the Zombie may temporarily lose combat capability due to overwhelming pain.
    

This creates a forced decision between indulgence or incapacitation.

---

## **Suppression Methods**

- Sedatives can reduce the intensity of the curse.
    
- Standard medicines lose effectiveness over time due to resistance buildup.
    
- Beyonder-crafted sedatives (e.g., Apothecary-grade) are significantly more potent and longer-lasting.
    

However, suppression only delays the hunger — it does not remove it.

---

## **Curse Replacement Rule**

- The Zombie’s Curse **replaces** both the Lunatic’s Curse and the Werewolf’s Curse.
    
- These curses do not stack.
    
- At this Sequence and beyond, only the Zombie’s Curse remains active.
